    After you run a simulation, you can explore the results in the <b>Results tab</b>. The first table shows the parameters used in the simulation.
</p>

<p>
    The second table shows a summary evaluation of the literature is provided considering only the published findings or all findings. True effects are defined as those larger than the minimum effect of interest. See below a list and explanation of each measure:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>True Positives</b></li>
Percentage of effects that yielded positive results and have a magnitude greater than the minimum of interest.

<li><b>True Negatives</b></li>
Percentage of effects that yielded negative results and have a magnitude lower than the minimum of interest.

<li><b>False Positives</b></li>
Percentage of effects that yielded positive results but have a magnitude lower than the minimum of interest.

<li><b>False Negatives</b></li>
Percentage of effects that yielded negative results but have a magnitude greater than the minimum of interest.

<li><b>Signal Error</b></li>
Rate of signal errors - effects that were estimated to be significant and have a different sign than the real underlying effect.

<li><b>Exaggeration Factor</b></li>
Median ratio between effect size estimates and real underlying effects, for effects which are estimated with the correct signal.

<li><b>Median Discovered Effect Size</b></li>
Median of the size of the true effects detected as significant (true positives).

<li><b>Positive Predictive Value</b></li>
Ratio of true positive effects out of all positive effects (true positives and false positives).

<li><b>Negative Predictive Value</b></li>
Ratio of true negative effects out of all negative effects (true negatives and false negatives).
</ul>

<p>
    The graph shows the estimates of effect sizes as a histogram and/or density curve, overlapping with the underlying distribution of effects sizes for comparison. The blue dotted lines indicate the minimum effect of interest. Options for the graph are shown in the right, allowing one to show/hide biased results or show all the estimates instead of just the ones that were published.
